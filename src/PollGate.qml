// Whether it is worth asking the server at all right now.
//
// A poll is never free. It is a token refresh, a round trip, and on a metered
// API it is part of a budget - and a plugin that polls on a fixed timer spends
// all of that while the laptop is locked in a bag with no network. The three
// things the compositor and the system bus already know are enough to stop:
//
//   away     nobody has touched the machine for `idleSeconds`. Inhibitors are
//            respected, so a full-screen video call - which holds one - counts
//            as being at the machine even with no input.
//   offline  NetworkManager says there is no connectivity. Only a flat "none"
//            counts: a captive portal or a limited link may still carry a
//            tenant's traffic, and guessing wrong here means a mailbox that
//            never refreshes.
//   battery  on battery the cadence is stretched rather than stopped, and
//            stretched further in the power-saver profile, because the user
//            asking the system for less power is asking us too.
//
// Both signals arrive late: for the first second or two of a shell's life
// UPower has no devices, NetworkManager reports Unknown connectivity, and
// `canCheckConnectivity` is false. Every default here therefore means "go
// ahead" - a gate that fails closed would swallow the first fetch after every
// shell start, which is the one fetch that fills an empty panel.
