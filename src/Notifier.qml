// Desktop notifications for things that have just arrived.
//
// What counts as "just arrived" is decided here rather than by the helper,
// because it means "since this shell started watching" and not "since the
// account was last read". The first answer after a sign-in - or after a laptop
// wakes up to a morning's mail - is an entire mailbox at once, and announcing
// all of it is exactly the behaviour that makes people turn notifications off
// for good. So the first round through a scope primes it silently, and only
// what turns up after that is announced.
//
// Scopes keep one mailbox's first round from being taken as another's second:
// a store watching two accounts primes each of them on its own.
