#
# Offscreen means no window on anyone's screen: the harness cannot be occluded
# by another window, cannot be sent to a workspace nobody is looking at, and
# cannot land on top of what someone else is doing. It draws its own
# screenshots - see shot.sh. Unlike showcase.sh it never touches your
# shell.json, so it is the one that is safe to run while you are using Teams.
#
# It is restarted rather than hot-reloaded because Quickshell's reload popup
# needs a real window, and failing to open it leaves IPC refusing queries.
