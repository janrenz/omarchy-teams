// Text you can select and copy.

// A QML Text item cannot be selected at all - no drag, no Ctrl+C, nothing - so
// anything a reader might want to take out of a message has to be a read-only
// TextEdit instead. That is the whole difference; everything else here is the
// defaults that make a TextEdit behave like the Text it replaces.
//
// textFormat is pinned to PlainText here rather than left to AutoText, for the
// same reason every Text item in this plugin pins it: AutoText decides a string
// is markup the moment it finds a `<`, and markup fetches what it is told to
// fetch. Callers that really are rendering markup override it deliberately.
